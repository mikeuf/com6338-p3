            <p>The main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects. Natural causes of death include adverse temperatures, predation by crocodiles on young, and disease.</p>
            <p>All three species of manatee are listed by the World Conservation Union as vulnerable to extinction.
                    It is illegal under federal and Florida law to injure or harm a manatee. They are classified as "endangered" by both the state and the federal governments.
                    The MV Freedom Star and MV Liberty Star, ships used by NASA to tow space shuttle solid rocket boosters back to Kennedy Space Center, are propelled only by water jets to protect the endangered manatee population that inhabits regions of the Banana River where the ships are based.
                    Brazil outlawed hunting in 1973 in an effort to preserve the species. Deaths by boat strikes are still common.
                    In January 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that the West Indian manatee be reclassified from an "endangered" status to "threatened" as improvements to habitat conditions, population growth and reductions of threats have all increased. The proposal will not affect current federal protections.
                    As of February 2016, 6,250 manatees were reported swimming in Florida's springs.</p>
